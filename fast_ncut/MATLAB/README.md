# Fast Normalized Cut with Linear Constraints MATLAB implementation
- fast_ncut.m
    - implementation of Fast normalized cut Algorithm.
- img2graph.m
    - Image data convert to Graph Matrix.
- notebook.m
    - Sample code.

# Dataset
- Download Dataset(format: Image)
    - We use a The Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and Benchmark.
    - Download Link :  `https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/BSDS300-images.tgz`
    - After Download, We use images in the test directory.

## Example


## TODO
- [ ] More Constraints Options in `fast_ncut.m`
    - [ ] CL : Cannot Link
    - [ ] ML : Must Link
    - [ ] Control over the size of the segmentation)
- [ ] Experiment result (Image segmentation)
- [ ] Add Example

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2016a
